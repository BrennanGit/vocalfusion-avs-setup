# xCORE VocalFusion 4-Mic Kit for AVS and Amazon Alexa Voice Services SDK on a Raspberry Pi

The XMOS **xCORE VocalFusion 4-Mic Kit for AVS** provides far-field voice capture using the XMOS XVF3000 voice processor.

Combined with a Raspberry Pi running the Amazon Alexa Voice Service (AVS) Software Development Kit (SDK), this kit allows you to quickly prototype and evaluate talking with Alexa.

This respository provides a simple-to-use automated script to install the Amazon AVS SDK on a Raspberry Pi and configure the Raspberry Pi to use the **xCORE VocalFusion 4-Mic Kit for AVS** for audio.

## Prerequisites
You will need:

- **xCORE VocalFusion 4-Mic Kit for Amazon AVS**: XK-VF3000-L33-AVS
- Raspberry Pi 3
- Micro-USB power supply (min. 2A)
- MicroSD card (min. 16GB)
- Powered mono speaker with audio 3.5mm analogue plug
- Monitor with HDMI input
- HDMI cable
- Fast-Ethernet connection with internet connectivity

You will also need an Amazon Developer account: https://developer.amazon.com 

## Hardware setup
Setup your hardware by following the **Hardware Setup** at: https://xmos.com/vocalfusion-avs

## AVS SDK installation and Raspberry Pi audio setup
Full instructions to install the AVS SDK on to a Raspberry Pi and configure the audio to use the **xCORE VocalFusion 4-Mic Kit for AVS** are detailed in the **Getting Started Guide** available from: https://xmos.com/vocalfusion-avs.

Brief instructions and additional notes are below:

1. Install Raspbian (Stretch) on the Raspberry Pi.

2. Open a terminal on the Raspberry Pi and clone this respository:  
`cd ~; git clone https://github.com/xmos/vocalfusion-avs-setup`

3. Either:  
create a new Alexa device by following: https://github.com/alexa/alexa-avs-sample-app/wiki/Create-Security-Profile  
(Note: the *Allowed Origins* and *Allowed Return URLs* should use http, not https.)  
Or:  
use an existing Alexa device by placing your `AlexaClientSDKConfig.json` file (with a valid refresh token) in the `~/vocalfusion-avs-setup/scripts/` folder.

4. Run the installation script: `source ~/vocalfusion-avs-setup/auto_install.sh`  
If necessary, enter your Alexa device details (*ProductID*, *ClientID* and *ClientSecret*).  
Wait for the sensory (keyword detection) repository to clone, then read and accept the license agreement.  
Wait for the script to complete the installation. This can take a while, for example:
   - audio-setup: 5m25s
   - apt-get deps: 2m13s
   - getsrc: 3m11s
   - nghttp2: 1m29s
   - openssl: 9m19s
   - curl: 3m50s
   - gstreamer: 5m47s
   - gst-plugins-base: 6m35s
   - libav: 22m45s
   - gst-plugins-bad: 9m33s
   - gst-plugins-good: 11m3s
   - portaudio: 1m1s
   - sensory: 0m1s
   - getsdk: 0m34s
   - configsdk: 0m14s
   - buildsdk: 36m28s
   - **TOTAL: 1h59m28s**

5. As a final step, the script will open http://localhost:3000 in a browser on the Raspberry Pi. Enter your Amazon Developer credentials and close the browser window when prompted. (You won't have to do this if you already have a valid configuration file.)  
If you want to add your own configuration file later, paste it into: `~/BUILD/Integration/`

6. Enter `sudo reboot` to reboot the Raspberry Pi and complete the audio setup.

7. Enter `avsrun` to run the sample app, `avsunit` to run the unit tests and `avsintegration` to run the integration tests.
